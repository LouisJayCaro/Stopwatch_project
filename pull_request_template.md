### Summary
Added the source code for the stopwatch GUI using PyQt5.  I also used the 
Qt designer tool that comes with `PyQt5 Tools`
So far, only the Start, Pause and Reset functions have been implemented. 
The Lap function will be assigned to another person. 

So far, I have used just one major package for this.

`pip install pyqt5`
